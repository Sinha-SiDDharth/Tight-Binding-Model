# Tight-Binding Model Simulations

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating fundamental and advanced concepts in **tight-binding modeling (TBM)** of quantum systems and solid-state materials. The simulations explore energy dispersion, band structure formation, and orbital contributions in various 1D and 2D lattice systems.
