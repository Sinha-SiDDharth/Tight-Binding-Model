# Tight-Binding Model Simulations

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating both fundamental and advanced concepts in tight-binding modeling (TBM) of quantum systems and solid-state materials. The simulations cover energy dispersion, band structure formation, and orbital contributions across 1D and 2D lattice systems.

## ðŸ§¾ About

Python-based numerical simulations using the Tight-Binding Model to explore band structures, dispersion relations, and electronic properties of low-dimensional materials. The models span systems like infinite 1D chains, Peierls-distorted lattices, graphene, and III-V semiconductors (e.g., GaAs) under various boundary conditions and lattice geometries.
