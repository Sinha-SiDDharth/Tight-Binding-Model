# Tight-Binding-Model
Python-based numerical simulations using the Tight-Binding Model to compute band structures, density of states, and dispersion relations for low-dimensional systems. Includes studies of 1D chains, Peierls-distorted lattices, graphene, and III-V semiconductors like GaAs under various boundary conditions and lattice symmetries.
